You've reached the about page of the personal site of Ted Roden.

I'm the Founder of [Fancy Hands](http://www.fancyhands.com) &amp; [Queso Victorious](http://quesovic.com). I once wrote a book called [Building the Realtime User Experience](http://amzn.to/1MkE60r), taught a class an NYU called [Labor in a Mobile-First World](https://github.com/tedroden/nyu-labor-class), and made a site called [enjoysthin.gs](http://enjoysthings.tumblr.com/) <sup>RIP</sup>. 

In the past, I've worked in the R+D group at The New York Times, Vimeo (employee 8?), Network Ninja, and bit.ly.
